# songlistApi
I'm a tech writer. I created this API using Python and Flask, with the help of several tutorials and one commit from a programmer friend. It's a simple API of songs I know, created so I could document it with SwaggerHub and share that documentation as a sample on my portfolio site (www.petewitcher-techwriter.com).
